                                        Amount, the difference would have to be paid by the Allottee(s)
                                        from his/her/their/its own sources and ensure there is no
                                        outstanding bank loan with respect to the said Apartment. In case
                                        the Allottee(s) refuses to make such differential payment, the
                                        Developer may make such payment on his/her/their/its behalf.
                                        This payment shall be recovered from the Allottee(s) together with
                                        such minimal annually compounded interest at 18% or such

                                        (regardless of whether the Developer has refunded the Sale
