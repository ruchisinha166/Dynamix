                                    Consideration received by the Promoter to the Allottee(s) (hereinafter referred to as the “Refund Amount”). 
                                    In case the Allottee(s) has availed any loans (including subvention/ deferred payment scheme or if the Promoter
                                    has made any payments corresponding to Pre-EMI interest on behalf of the Allottee(s), in any manner whatsoever),
                                    for payment of the Allotment Premium/ Sale Consideration then in such case the amounts disbursed by the lending 
                                    Bank/Financial Institution to the Promoter, shall be refunded by the Promoter to such lending Bank/ Financial 
                                    Institution (after deducting any payments made by the Promoter with respect to such Pre-EMI interest on behalf 
                                    of the Allottee(s), in any manner whatsoever) directly and the Allottee(s) authorizes the Promoter to collect 
                                    the original Agreement for Sale from such Bank/Financial Institution and the Promoter shall not be required to 
                                    take any consent / confirmation from the Allottee(s) in this regard at any time. It is clarified herein that in case 
                                    the amount of loan/ financial facility amount availed by the Allottee(s) is greater than the Sale Consideration received
                                    by the Promoter less the Forfeiture Amount, the difference would have to be paid by the Allottee(s) from his/her/their/its 
                                    own sources and ensure there is no outstanding bank loan with respect to the said Apartment. In case the Allottee(s) 
                                    refuses to make such differential payment, the Promoter may make such payment on his/her/their/its behalf. This payment
                                    shall be recovered from the Allottee(s) together with such minimal annually compounded interest at 18% or such annually
                                    compounded interest rate which shall in no event be less than 200 basis points above the borrowing cost of the Promoter.
                                    Upon the termination of this Agreement by the Promoter (regardless of whether the Promoter has refunded the Sale 
                                    Consideration less Forfeiture Amount to the Allottee(s)), the Allottee(s) shall have no claim of any nature whatsoever
